This code has been made to be modular. You need to diferentiate "apps" from the "core" of the calculator, the "core" is the art handling the calculation, the interaction with the screen and buttons,etc while the "apps" only handle it through the "core" function. Currently "apps" are `Calc.cpp` ,`elements.cpp`,`grapher.cpp`, `menu.cpp` and `sequence.cpp` (not fully implemented yet) and the "core" is made of `ui.cpp`,`Evaluator.cpp` and `stack.cpp`. If you want to contribute, please keep it that way, it helps to have an overall coherence in the code, avoid to write twice the same code
